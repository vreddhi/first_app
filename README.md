# cli-onboard
Provides a way to onboard a new Akamai Property Manager configuration using any flexible user-defined setup.  You can include any desired settings (subject to authorization and entitlements) such as:
* Any property mangager configuration json rule template
* Standard TLS or Enhanced TLS Network
* Use new or existing SSL Certificates and Edge Hostnames
* Include in existing WAF configurations (Add Selected Hosts and/or Match Targets)
* Flexible activation to staging or production network

## Akamai CLI Install
```bash
%  akamai install onboard
%  akamai install property-manager (if not already installed)
```

## Local Install
* Python 3+
* pip install edgegrid-python
* User should also have [cli-property-manager](https://github.com/akamai/cli-property-manager) installed

### Credentials
In order to use this module, you need to:
* Set up your credentials in your .edgerc file 
* The default section used in your configuration file should be called 'onboard'. If you wish to override, you may also use the --section <name> to use the specific section credentials from your .edgerc file
* Your API credential should include at least the following grants:
  * Property Manager (/papi)
  * Edge Hostnames API (/hapi)
  * Certificate Provisioning System (/cps)
  * Application Security (/appsec)    


```
[onboard]
client_secret = [CLIENT_SECRET]
host = [HOST]
access_token = [ACCESS_TOKEN_HERE]
client_token = [CLIENT_TOKEN_HERE]
```

### Example Usage


```bash
akamai onboard create --file /templates/sample_setup.json
akamai onboard create --file ~/path/to/setup.json
```

### Field Descriptions:

* property_name:  Name of the property manager configuration to be created
* secure_network: Use either ENHANCED_TLS or STANDARD_TLS
* contract_id:    Contract ID (starts with ctr_)
* group_id:       Group ID (starts with grp_)
* product_id:     Product ID (usually starts with prd_ and should be one of available products from specified contract_id)
* rule_format:    Rule format (typically latest, but can you frozen rule format if desired)
----------
**default_cpcode**
* create_new_cpcode: Specify true if you want a brand new cp code created as part of the new property manager configuration
* new_cpcode_name:   If create_new_cpcode is true, specify name of new cp code
----------
**file_info**
* use_file: Specify true if you want to use a single file json template
* source_template_file: File path to single file json template. This file can have ${env.variable} references to serve place holders that will be substitued from values in source_values_file
* source_values_file: File path to the single file variable values.  This source values file can look like this:

```bash
{
	"origin_default": "origin-www.dummy.com",
	"cpcode_default": 12345
}
```
----------
**folder_info**
* use_folder: Specify true if you want to use an existing Akamai pipeline folder structure. This folder should contain the projectInfo.json and environments folder
* folder_path: File path to the Akamai pipeline folder
* env_name: Environment name to build. This name should be defined in projectInfo.json and have corrent setting and variable values in environments folder
----------
**public_hostnames** 
* Array of property hostnames in this new configuration
----------
**edge_hostname** 
* For a new property manager configuration, we can use an existing edge hostname, create a new standard_tls edge hostname, or create a new enhanced_tls edge hostname
* mode: Should be one of: use_existing_edgehostname, new_standard_tls_edgehostname, new_enhanced_tls_edgehostname
----------
**use_existing_edgehostname**
* edge_hostname: Specify the existing edge hostname to use. If using ENHANCED_TLS, this should end with edgekey.net ; otherwise if using STANDARD_TLS, this should end with edgesuite.net
----------
**new_enhanced_tls_edgehostname -- use existing enrollment**
* use_existing_enrollment_id: Set to true if you want to create a new edge hostname from an existing certificate enrollment. If true, you must also put in values for the existing_enrollment_id and existing_slot_number.
* existing_enrollment_id: Enrollment ID of the existing certificate
* existing_slot_number: Slot number for the existing certificate
----------
**new_enhanced_tls_edgehostname -- create new enrollment**
* create_new_ssl_cert: Set to true if you want to brand new certificate enrollment. If true, you must also put in values for the ssl_cert_template_file, ssl_cert_template_values, and use_temp_existing_edge_hostname_id
* ssl_cert_template_file: File path to ssl certificate template json file. This can be for any certificate type (see templates/ssl_certs folder for some examples)
* ssl_cert_template_values: Values for the ssl certificate template to be used (see templates/ssl_certs folder for some examples)
* temp_existing_edge_hostname: Due to backend api limitations, a new edge hostname cannot be immediately made that references a newly created certificate enrollment for a brief period of time. Rather than be blocked by this process, specify a temporary edge hostname to use as a placeholder. This value is not really used and just a place holder to proceed with the property manager configuration creation. If using ENHANCED_TLS, use an existing edge hostname ends with edgekey.net ; otherwise if using STANDARD_TLS, use an existing edge hostname that ends with edgesuite.net
----------
**update_waf_info**
* add_selected_host: Set to true if you want to add specified public_hostnames to WAF selected hosts
* waf_config-name: Name of security configuration
* update_match_target: Set to true if you wwant to add specified public_hostnames to specifed waf_match_target_id
* waf_match_target_id: waf match target id to add hostnames to (use numeric waf match target id)
* NOTE: These settings can only happen if property manager configuration is activated to Akamai staging
----------
**activate settings**
* activate_property_staging: Activate property manager configuration to staging network
* activate_property_production: Activate property manager configuration to production network (must go through staging first)
* activate_waf_policy_staging: Activate security configuration to staging network
* activate_waf_policy_production: Activate security configuration to production network (must go through staging first)
* notification_emails: Array of emails to be notified after activations
